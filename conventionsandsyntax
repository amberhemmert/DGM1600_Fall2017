/*
Convention is how the code "looks" which means the space or indent. Often code is nested in other code. 
Syntax, simply put is computer grammar. How your code is typed out will determine the function read by the computer and it needs to be entered in correctly. 

Examples:
  an error would be public int health = "Fish"; (using a string when you have an int would cause an error) 
  
 Convention rules exisit to keep the code base manageable in C++.
 -rules for indentation and alignment
 -use of whitespace and comments
 -program structure
